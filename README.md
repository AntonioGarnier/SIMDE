## What is SIMDE?

SIMDE is a simulator for supporting teaching of ILP (Instruction Level Parallelism) Architectures. This simulator is a visual representation of a Superecalar machine execution and the students are able to see how the instructions move through the multiple stages of the machine. 

This make easier to learn concepts suchs as *Tomasulo's algorithm* and the purpose of structures such as the reorderbuffer.

## Technologies
